## What You'll See

### In "Calls" Tab:
- ✅ **Call Tracking Section**: Native app call logs
  - Phone number
  - Call direction (outgoing/incoming icons)
  - Call status (completed, missed, etc.)
  - Duration and talk time
  - Who made the call
  - When the call happened

### In "History" Tab:
- ✅ **Location History Section**: Check-ins and tracking
  - Location type badge (Check-in/Tracking/Geofence)
  - Address or coordinates
  - Accuracy (in meters)
  - Notes (if any)
  - Who recorded it
  - When it was recorded

## Troubleshooting

**If you don't see the tabs:**
- Make sure you **tapped on a lead** (not just viewing the list)
- The dialog should open with tabs visible at the top
- If tabs are cut off, try scrolling up in the dialog

**If tabs are too small on mobile:**
- The tabs should be responsive and adjust to screen size
- Try rotating your phone to landscape mode for better visibility

**If no data appears:**
- Make sure you've made calls or checked in from the native app
- Data only appears after:
  - Making a call using the app's call button
  - Clicking "Check In" button on a lead
  - Starting location tracking

## Quick Test

1. Open any lead
2. Click "Calls" tab → Should see "Call Tracking" section
3. Click "History" tab → Should see "Location History" section

If you still can't find them, let me know and I can help troubleshoot!
